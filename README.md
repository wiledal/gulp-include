> Works with gulp 3 and gulp 4

## Features
* Concatenate files with full control
* Respects indentation whitespace
* Uses [globs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) for simple path control
* Works recursively (files can include files that can include files, and so on)

## Installation
```shell
npm install gulp-include
```
## Usage
Example `gulpfile.js`:
```javascript
var gulp          = require("gulp"),
    include       = require("gulp-include");

gulp.task("scripts", function() {
  console.log("-- gulp is running task 'scripts'");

  gulp.src("src/js/main.js")
    .pipe(include())
      .on('error', console.log)
    .pipe(gulp.dest("dist/js"));
});

gulp.task("default", ["scripts"]);

```

## Options
- `extensions` (optional)
  * Takes a `String` or an `Array` of extensions.
  eg: `"js"` or `["js", "coffee"]`
  * If set, all directives that does not match the extension(s) will be ignored


- `includePaths` (optional)
  * Takes a `String` or an `Array` of paths.
  eg: `__dirname + "/node_modules"` or `[__dirname + "/assets/js", __dirname + "/bower_components"]`
  * If set, `gulp-include` will use these folders as base path when searching for files.


- `hardFail` (optional)
  * Boolean, `false` by default
  * Set this to `true` if you want `gulp-include` to throw errors if a file does not match
  an include directive.
  * If set to `false` gulp include will not fail, but display warnings in the console.
  
- `separateInputs` (optional)
  * Boolean, `true` by default
  * Set this to `false` if you want to process each input file independent, when executing "require" logic. 
  So, if file required several times inside one file (or inside required by it files), then dublicates will be ignored. 
  But when another file will begin processing, all information about required files from previuos file will be discarded.


- `debugIncludes` (optional)
  * Boolean, `false` by default
  * Set this to `true` if you want `gulp-include` to output included filenames to the console.

#### Example options usage:
```js
gulp.src("src/js/main.js")
  .pipe(include({
    extensions: "js",
    hardFail: true,
    includePaths: [
      __dirname + "/bower_components",
      __dirname + "/src/js"
    ],
    debugIncludes: true
  }))
  .pipe(gulp.dest("dist/js"));
```

## Include directives
`gulp-include` uses directives similar to `sprockets` or `snockets`. A _directive_ is a comment in your files that `gulp-include` recognizes as a command.

Example directives:
```javascript
//=require vendor/jquery.js
//=require vendor/**/*.js
//=include relative/path/to/file.js
```
```css
/*=include relative/path/to/file.css */
```
```coffee
#=include relative/path/to/file.coffee
```
```html
<!--=include relative/path/to/file.html -->
```

The contents of the referenced file will replace the file.

### `require` vs. `include`
A file that is included with `require` will only be included if it has not been included  before. Files included with `include` will _always_ be included.
For instance, let's say you want to include `jquery.js` only once, and before any of your other scripts in the same folder.
```javascript
//=require vendor/jquery.js
//=require vendor/*.js
```
Note: This also works recursively. If for instance, for the example above, if another file in the folder `vendor` is also including `jquery.js` with the `require`-directive it will be ignored.
