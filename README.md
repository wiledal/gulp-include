#gulp-include [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![Travis build][travis-image]
>Makes inclusion of files a breeze.  
Enables functionality similar to that of snockets / sprockets or other file insertion compilation tools.

> Made for gulp 3

## Features
* Concatenate files with full control
* Respects indentation whitespace
* Uses [globs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) for simple path control
* Works recursively (files can include files that can include files, and so on)

*Warning: if you are updating from 1.x.x to 2.x.x, please read this readme to get up to date on the behavior of `gulp-include`*

## Installation
```shell
npm install gulp-include
```
## Usage
Example `gulpfile.js`:
```javascript
var gulp          = require("gulp"),
    include       = require("gulp-include");

gulp.task("scripts", function() {
  console.log("-- gulp is running task 'scripts'");

  gulp.src("src/js/main.js")
    .pipe(include())
      .on('error', console.log)
    .pipe(gulp.dest("dist/js"));
});

gulp.task("default", ["scripts"]);

```

## Options
* `extensions` (optional)
	* Takes a `String` or an `Array` of extensions, eg: `"js"` or `["js", "coffee"]`
	* If set, all directives that does not match the extension(s) will be ignored
	
* `absolutePath` (optional)
	* default is false, relativeBasePath + "/" + "abc.js";
	* enable absolute path, e.g: "//=require ./Scripts/app/*.js"

## Include directives
`gulp-include` uses directives similar to `sprockets` or `snockets`. A _directive_ is a comment in your files that `gulp-include` recognizes as a command.
  
Example directives:
```javascript
//=require vendor/jquery.js
//=require vendor/**/*.js
//=include relative/path/to/file.js
```
```css
/*=include relative/path/to/file.css */
```
```coffee
#=include relative/path/to/file.coffee
```
```html
<!--=include relative/path/to/file.html -->
```

The contents of the referenced file will replace the file.
  
### `require` vs. `include`
A file that is included with `require` will only be included if it has not been included  before. Files included with `include` will _always_ be included.  
For instance, let's say you want to include `jquery.js` only once, and before any of your other scripts in the same folder.
```javascript
//=require vendor/jquery.js
//=require vendor/*.js
```
Note: This also works recursively. If for instance, for the example above, if another file in the folder `vendor` is also including `jquery.js` with the `require`-directive it will be ignored.

## Release log
#### 2.1.0
* Merged sourcemap support by [vetruvet](https://github.com/vetruvet)
* Merged support for html-comments by [jelmerdemaat](https://github.com/jelmerdemaat)

#### 2.0.3
* Merged community fix by [shadow1runner](https://github.com/shadow1runner)

#### 2.0.2
* Updated replace to support specials [Riim](https://github.com/Riim)

#### 2.0.1
* Fixed an issue with indenting

#### 2.0.0
* Core rewritten to be slimmer and more comprehensive.
* `require` and `include` no longer work the same. `require` will only include a file that hasn't been included yet. See readme for details.
* Tests have been rewritten based on the old ones, but also to fit the new functionality
* Deprecated `require_tree` and `require_directory` as they serve little purpose. Use globs (`path/to/**/*.xxx`) instead.

#### 1.1.1
* Merged community fix by [trolev](https://github.com/trolev)

#### 1.1.0
* Merged feature: Keep leading whitespaces by [maxgalbu](https://github.com/maxgalbu)

#### 1.0.1
* Fixed issue which caused extensions to be "remembered" if `gulp-include` ran multiple times in a row, resulting in lost includes

#### 1.0.0
* Merged major refactoring by [scottmas](https://github.com/scottmas) - Many thanks!
	* Rewritten core (regex, replacing and file mashing)
	* Glob support
	* Recursive support
	* Respecting indentation of included files

* Upping version to 1.0.0 - seems fitting after such a large refactor

#### 0.2.3
* Merged community fixes by [platdesign](https://github.com/platdesign) and [cujojp](https://github.com/cujojp)

#### 0.2.2
* Updated regex directive to not collide with other requireing plugins, like browserify ([cwacek](https://github.com/cwacek))

#### 0.2.1
* Changed replace-method to fix issue when requiring a file that contained special characters ([juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado))

#### 0.2.0
* Added `require_tree`/`include_tree` (Thanks to [juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado)!)
* Method now takes an `extensions` param for controlling what types of files to include
