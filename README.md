#gulp-include [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![Travis build][travis-image]
>Makes inclusion of files a breeze.  
Enables functionality similar to that of snockets / sprockets or other file insertion compilation tools.

> Made for gulp 3


## Usage
First, install `gulp-include` as a dev dependency:
`npm install --save-dev gulp-include`

Then, add your _include-comments_ to your file.  
_People who have experience with `sprockets` or `snockets` will feel at home._


An _include-comment_ looks like this:
```javascript
//= include relative/path/to/file.js
```
or if you want to get crazy, a glob pattern like so:
```javascript
//= include relative/path/to/directory/*.js
```

or to get even crazier, an array glob similar to commonly used in GruntJS:
```javascript
//= include ['app/someFramework.js', 'app/**/*.js', '!app/vendor/**/*', 'app/someLibrary.js']
```

(Note: for those of you unfamiliar with the above syntax, check out https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob
or http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns)

You can do all of this in any language, the only requirement is that the first character
 on the line after any #, /, or white space characters is an equal sign.
```coffeescript
#= require_tree relative/path/to/directory
```
`gulp-include` disregards whitespace, as long as the comment-line starts with a _newline_ followed `=` and contains `include`, `require` or `include_tree`, `require_tree`.

This plugin recursively expand files it includes, so you can nest includes inside of files that
    were themselves included. IE:

`main.js`:
```
//= include included_file.js
```

`included_file.js`:
```
//= include recursive_include.js
```
And so on recursively to an arbitrary depth.

The example below compiles a several coffee-files and js-files into a single js-file:

`app.coffee`:

```coffeescript
`
//= require vendor/jquery.js
//= require vendor/modernizr.js
`

#= require controllers/AppController.coffee
#= require_tree views

class Main extends AppController
	constructor: ->
		console.log "This is main!"

window.main = new Main()
```
*Note:* The example above uses backticks (\`) to allow `gulp-coffee` to compile inline javascript

`gulpfile.js default`:

```javascript
var gulp		= require('gulp'),
	include		= require('gulp-include'),
	coffee		= require('gulp-coffee');

gulp.task("scripts", function() {
	gulp.src('src/js/app.coffee')
		.pipe( include() )
		.pipe( coffee() )
		.pipe( gulp.dest("dist/js") )
});

gulp.task("default", "scripts");
```

`gulpfile.js with includePaths`:

```javascript
var gulp		= require('gulp'),
	include		= require('gulp-include'),
	coffee		= require('gulp-coffee'),
    path		= require('path');

gulp.task("scripts", function() {
	gulp.src('src/js/app.coffee')
		.pipe( include({
			includePaths: [
				path.resolve('./')+'/Neos/Packages/Plugins',
				path.resolve('./')+'/Neos/Packages/Sites'
			]
		}) )
		.pipe( coffee() )
		.pipe( gulp.dest("dist/js") )
});

gulp.task("default", "scripts");
```

## Options
* `extensions` (optional)
	* Takes a `String` or an `Array` of extensions, eg: `"js"` or `["js", "coffee"]`
	* If set, all inclusions that does not match the extension(s) will be ignored
* `includePaths` (optional)
	* Takes a `String` or an `Array` of absolute includePaths, eg: `"/Users/uname/project/Neos/Plugins"` or `["/Users/uname/project/Neos/Plugins", "/Users/uname/project/Neos/Sites"]`

## Release log
#### fork
* added functionality to use includePaths

#### 1.1.1
* Merged community fix by [trolev](https://github.com/trolev)

#### 1.1.0
* Merged feature: Keep leading whitespaces by [maxgalbu](https://github.com/maxgalbu)

#### 1.0.1
* Fixed issue which caused extensions to be "remembered" if `gulp-include` ran multiple times in a row, resulting in lost includes

#### 1.0.0
* Merged major refactoring by [scottmas](https://github.com/scottmas) - Many thanks!
	* Rewritten core (regex, replacing and file mashing)
	* Glob support
	* Recursive support
	* Respecting indentation of included files

* Upping version to 1.0.0 - seems fitting after such a large refactor

#### 0.2.3
* Merged community fixes by [platdesign](https://github.com/platdesign) and [cujojp](https://github.com/cujojp)

#### 0.2.2
* Updated regex directive to not collide with other requireing plugins, like browserify ([cwacek](https://github.com/cwacek))

#### 0.2.1
* Changed replace-method to fix issue when requiring a file that contained special characters ([juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado))

#### 0.2.0
* Added `require_tree`/`include_tree` (Thanks to [juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado)!)
* Method now takes an `extensions` param for controlling what types of files to include

#### 0.1.0
* Basic include
