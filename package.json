  "readme": "#gulp-include [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![Travis build][travis-image]\n>Makes inclusion of files a breeze.  \nEnables functionality similar to that of snockets / sprockets or other file insertion compilation tools.\n\n> Made for gulp 3\n\n\n## Usage\nFirst, install `gulp-include` as a dev dependency:\n`npm install --save-dev gulp-include`\n\nThen, add your _include-comments_ to your file.  \n_People who have experience with `sprockets` or `snockets` will feel at home._ \n\n\nAn _include-comment_ looks like this:\n```javascript\n//= include relative/path/to/file.js\n```\nor \n```coffeescript\n#= require_tree relative/path/to/folder\n```\nor even\n```javascript\n/*\n= include relative/path/to/file.js\n= require relative/path/to/file2.js\n= include_tree relative/path/to/folder\n*/\n```\n`gulp-include` does not care about whitespace, as long as the comment-line starts with a  _newline_ followed `=` and contains `include`, `require` or `include_tree`, `require_tree`.\n\n\nThe example below compiles a several coffee-files and js-files into a single js-file:\n\n`app.coffee`:\n\n```coffeescript\n`\n//= require vendor/jquery.js\n//= require vendor/modernizr.js\n`\n\n#= require controllers/AppController.coffee\n#= require_tree views\n\nclass Main extends AppController\n\tconstructor: ->\n\t\tconsole.log \"This is main!\"\n\nwindow.main = new Main()\n```\n*Note:* The example above uses backsticks (\\`) to allow `gulp-coffee` to compile inline javascript\n\n`gulpfile.js`:\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp\t\t= require('gulp'),\n\tinclude\t\t= require('gulp-include'),\n\tcoffee\t\t= require('gulp-coffee');\n\ngulp.task(\"scripts\", function() {\n\tgulp.src('src/js/app.coffee')\n\t\t.pipe( include() )\n\t\t.pipe( coffee() )\n\t\t.pipe( gulp.dest(\"dist/js\") )\n});\n\ngulp.task(\"default\", \"scripts\");\n```\n\n## Options\n* `extensions` (optional)\n\t* Takes a `String` or an `Array` of extensions, eg: `\"js\"` or `[\"js\", \"coffee\"]`\n\t* If set, all inclusions that does not match the extension(s) will be ignored\n\n## Release log\n#### 0.2.3\n* Merged community fixes by [platdesign](https://github.com/platdesign) and [cujojp](https://github.com/cujojp)\n\n#### 0.2.2\n* Updated regex directive to not collide with other requireing plugins, like browserify ([cwacek](https://github.com/cwacek))\n\n#### 0.2.1\n* Changed replace-method to fix issue when requiring a file that contained special characters ([juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado))\n\n#### 0.2.0\n* Added `require_tree`/`include_tree` (Thanks to [juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado)!)\n* Method now takes an `extensions` param for controlling what types of files to include\n\n#### 0.1.0\n* Basic include\n\n## Licence\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Hugo Wiledal\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
